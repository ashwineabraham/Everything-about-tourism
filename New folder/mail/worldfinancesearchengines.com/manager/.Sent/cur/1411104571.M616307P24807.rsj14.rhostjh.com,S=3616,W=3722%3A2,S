Hi Murray,

I thought I would confirm the steps to take when editing, and then we 
can discuss each step when you call tomorrow afternoon....

(1) To get to Admin page with the listings, log in with 
_www.worldfinancesearchengines.com/login.php _and then U/N 
"Brian36Bowe", password "finance1"

(3) Click on Providers/All providers

(2) On the left hand side, click on the down arrow and that will bring 
up all the Countries.

(3) Click on which country you wish to open and edit. (I have done up 
to, but not including Brazil).

(4) Those listings that have a red cross, double click on them and their 
details will come up...then click on red printing at the bottom which 
says "Mark this Provider for deletion". This will then take you to the 
next page...click "YES" option, ignore the "Reason" box and click on 
"Submit  deletion request".

(5) After a few seconds it will take you back to the list of companies, 
where you click on the next red crossed listing, and so on as above.

Thanks Murray.
