REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided to forward this proposal. We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of Sixteen Million United States Dollars (US$16,000,000.00) into your account. This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contract awarded by us under the budget allocation to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment by the concerned ministries.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
The contract has been executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract. We are left with the balance of US$16,000,000.00 as part of the over-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated, for our own I am contacting you to be our custodian for this fund.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
1. 20% for you (Account Owner)</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
2. 70% for us</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
3. 10% for Tax, as may require by our Government and yours. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address from adverts, in business directory that portrayed your establishment in good light. I am the Secretary of the Contract Awarding Committee (CAC) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISK and TROUBLE from my Government. We have been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity we cannot afford to miss. To get this fund paid into your account, we have to present a Payment Invoice from a foreign establishment like yours. With this invoice, we will seek approval to transfer the fund within 14 banking days through the APEX BANK to your designated Bank Account. One of my colleagues and I will come to your country to arrange for our share upon the confirmation from you that the money has been credited into your nominated Bank Account.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Consequently upon your acceptance of my proposal, kindly confirm your interest by revert mail to the above email address It will surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be discovered and business like this cannot be realized without trust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this transaction. we are looking forward to doing this transaction with you. Be further informed that everyone's interest and security had been considered before you were contacted. So be rest assured and feel free to go into this transaction with us. But let honesty be our watch word throughout this transaction and your prompt reply will be highly appreciated.</DIV>
<DIV>
