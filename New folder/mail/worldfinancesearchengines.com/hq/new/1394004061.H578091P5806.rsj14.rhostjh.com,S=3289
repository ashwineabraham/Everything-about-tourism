Hi,

I am Mr. Jack Zellman Director Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection
Agent in Hartsfield International Airport Atlanta Georgia. During our
investigation, I discovered An abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from United Kingdom under iship forwarder was transferred
from JF Kenned Airport to our facility here in Atlanta and when

scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box
weighing approximately 110k each.

The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly
declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as

personal effect to avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent also the
Diplomat inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees. On my assumption,

each of the boxes will contain more that $3 to $4M each and the
consignment is still left in storage house till today through a

registered shipping Company, Courier Dispatch Service Limited a
division of Tran guard LTD. The Consignment are two metal box with

weight of about 110kg each (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73
(cm). Effective capacity: 680 L.)Approximately, The details of the

consignment including your name in the official document from United
Nation office in London are tagged on the Metal Trunk box.

Provide your Phone Number full address, name of nearest Airport
around and other details or disregard. You can send the required

details to me for onward delivery.  All communication must be held
extremely confidential. I can get everything concluded within 3-6

hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.
But I must get assurance from you concerning my 50% before I

will proceed.

I want us to transact this business and share the money, since the
shippers have abandoned it and ran away. I will pay for the Non

inspection fee and arrange for the boxes to be moved out of this
Airport to your address, I will bring it by myself to avoid any more

trouble. But I will share it 50% to you and 50% to me. But you have to
assure me of my 50%. If
you agreed with my condition my personal Email is:  j.zellman33@aol.com
Below are my direct telephone number and I wait to hear from you.
