I GOT YOUR CONTACT FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE IN MY QUEST FOR SOMEONE TO BE  TRUSTED FOR A WIRE TRANSFER VALUED $7.5M.

MY NAME IS CHARLES FRANK OF TELEX/COMPUTER DEPARTMENT OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF  NIGERIA, FALOMO -LAGOS,NIGERIA.

SOME PAYMENT'S FILE WERE SUBMITTED TO MY OFFICE FOR THE AUTHENTICATION VERIFICATION EXERCISE BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE FUNDS TO THE
BENEFICIARIES.UNFORTUNATELY,THE DETAILS OF ONE BENEFICIARY(AMERICAN) WAS MISSING AND COULD NOT BE TRACED FOR PAYMENT.

NORMALLY,SUCH CASES SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE FOREIGN OPERATION’S DEPARTMENT TO BE RELEGATED TO THE NIGERIAN TREASURY AS NON-ATTENDEE BUT I THOUGHT IT WISE TO DIVERT THE PAYMENT TO AN OVER-SEA'S ACCOUNT FOR MY PERSONAL USE SINCE I’M THE ONLY PERSON THAT’S AWARE OF THIS CASE HENCE THE REASON OF CONTACTING YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.

ALL I NEEDED TO DO IS TO EFFECT SOME CHANGES ON THE DOCUMENTS OF THIS PAYMENT TO BEARING YOUR NAMES AS THE BENEFICIARY AND USE MY INFLUENCE IN THIS DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THE FUNDS TRANSFERRED INTO ANY ACCOUNT THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE.THOUGH THIS WILL COST SOME MONEY TO ACCOMPLISHED BUT I HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY GOTTEN THE SERVICES OF A LOAN AGENT THAT HAS PLEDGED /PROMISED TO FINANCE THIS TRANSACTION TO A CONCLUSIVE END.

HOWEVER,I AM READY TO OFFER YOU 30% OF THIS FUNDS IF YOU CAN PROVIDE AN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS PAYMENT COULD BE DIVERTED TO.THEN 10% TO SETTLE THE FINANCIER AND THE REST 60% FOR ME AND SOME OF THE OFFICIALS OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA THAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL SIGNATORIES WOULD BE NEEDED TO SECURE THE APPROVAL OF THIS PAYMENT.

I WANT TO STATE CATEGORICALLY HERE THAT THIS TRANSACTION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED 100% RISK FREE BY YOU BECAUSE I HAVE PERFECTED ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE LOGISTICS TO ENSURE THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE FUNDS INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR THIS PAYMENT.

PLEASE, I AM STILL VERY ACTIVE IN MY POSITION HERE SO UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY MUST BE ACCORDED TO THIS DETAILS.

UPON THE RECEIPT OF THIS MESSAGE, YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME WITH YOUR DETAILS TO START PROCESSING FOR THIS CLAIM IMMEDIATELY AS FOLLOWS:

YOUR NAMES (SURNAME FIRST):
MAILING ADDRESS:
AGE:
MARITAL STATUS:
TELEPHONE:
OCCUPATION:
