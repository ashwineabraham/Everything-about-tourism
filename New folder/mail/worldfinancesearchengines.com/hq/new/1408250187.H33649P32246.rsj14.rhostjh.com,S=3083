 Dear Beloved,
 Good day to you and your family, i am sorry to disturb you but i felt
 deeply in my heart that you are that individual that i have been looking
 for and so i can contact you for a blessing that you are about to receive
 and also share with people that need it, my name is Mr.Ali Fawaz, a
 merchant in Qatar. I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer,
 which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my
 health. This sickness has defied all forms of medicine, and right now I
 have only a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have since
 lost my power of speech and can only manage to write now, as that has been
 the only way I am able to communicate. I have not particularly lived my
 life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never Generous, I was always
 hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only
 thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is
 more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.
 I believe when i am given a second chance to come to this world I would
 live my life a different way from how i have lived it. Now that i have
 been called, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my
 immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.
 I want the almighty to be merciful to me and accept my soul, so i have
 decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of
 the last good deeds I do on earth. I want to believe that you will be
 capable of handling this task for me. I will wait to hear from you to know
 if you are capable of doing this favour for me, You will be bless as you
 have decided to do this, I will wait for your urgent response at my email
 address thank you for deciding to actualize this task for humanity sake.
 Regards,
 Ali Fawaz.

 N/B / Pls you can contact me through my email address (alfawa1@yahoo.com)
