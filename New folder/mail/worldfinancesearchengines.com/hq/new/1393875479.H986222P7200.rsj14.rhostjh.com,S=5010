EMAIL: (barristermartinsmark723@yahoo.com)

My name is barrister MARTINS MARK (Esq), I got your contact information from a reputable business/professional directory of your country which gives me assurance of your legibility as a person while trying to get a good and capable business for both business and investment purposes. like I said, I am Barrister MARTINS MARK. (Esq.) I was the Personal Attorney to late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who was a businessman in my country Nigeria but unfortunately he died in an air crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31st 2007,including his wife and only daughter.
Before the crash, Mr. Morris Thompson made a fixed deposit value of $20,000,000.00USD (TWENTY MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS) with the old STANDARD TRUST BANK OF NIGERIA Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, but there where no response. 
After a months or two found out that Mr. Morris Thompson and his family died in the plane crash that happened.
Further investigation being his personal attorney, proved that Mr. Morris Thompson's one and only next of kin was his daughter who died with him in the crash. I have made several contacts for any of his relative or family member but there is no response coming forth
What borders me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 8 years the funds will revert to federal government treasury account (FEDERAL REPUBLIC NIGERIA  GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT) if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, I needed a foreigner to assist me in getting this fund out from the government account because due to bad leaders we have in Africa, this fund will not be utilized but will be diverted into personal account of famous and top politicians in the country rather than using it for proper investment that will promote growth and development in the country or rather for charity work. So please I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. to my late client Mr. Morris Thompson so that you will be able to receive these funds for both of us. WHAT IS TO BE DONE?
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall
come out successfully. As a barrister, I will prepare the necessary documents
that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson and the most important thing needed is truth and truth for us to have it done.. PLEASE WHAT IS TO PROVIDE ME WITH YOUR  FULL INFORMATION SUCH AS STATED BELOW, SO THAT I WILL PREPARE THE NEEDED LEGAL DOCUMENTS

Also be informed that this Transaction will take us just 5-10 working days only
to accomplish beginning from when I receive the above information and you have been made the next of kin, I will file an application to the bank on your behalf as soon as I secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.
