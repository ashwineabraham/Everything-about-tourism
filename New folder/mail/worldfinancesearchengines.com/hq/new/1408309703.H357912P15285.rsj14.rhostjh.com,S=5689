Hi Sir/Madam,

I contacted you recently regarding lead generation and appointment
setting
services. I would like to know if you had a chance to think over our
proposal and if you might want to consider it for your business.

Just to give you an idea of what we do, we offer cold calling
services to
generate sales leads for our clients.

To make your campaign more efficient, we send out follow-up emails to
prospects, and follow that through with another call from our sales
rep to
provide additional info, answer questions, and qualify potential
customers
before setting an appointment with them on your behalf. By the time
prospects agree to meet with you, you can rest assured that they are
well-qualified and ready for business.

Do you have time today to discuss a bit about this program and how it
will
benefit your business? Just provide us the best number to reach you.
Our
Senior Sales Rep can call you or take your call anytime

Kind regards,

Zoe Myers |Marketing Associate
Multi Channel Marketing Leads
