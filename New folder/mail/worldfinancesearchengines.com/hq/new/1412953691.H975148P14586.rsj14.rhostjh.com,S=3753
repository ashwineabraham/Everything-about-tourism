Hi hq,

couldnt pick up the phone I wason with the wife you know how she is but =
please next time don't call the houseline, I would prefer if you come in =
to my office instead. In person is alwaysbetter. Anyway your timing is =
impeccable you are very lucky. There's this insanelittle company =
(confederation minerals) that was exchanging hands for like adollar and =
a half last year and now you can grab it for around 10 cents. Theseguys =
are sitting on gold, literaly. They have proven reserves worth a =
fewhundred mill and theyre about to begin digging out the stuff in a few =
months.

You better bet the stokc is gonna go nuts in the coming weeks when they =
make the drilling announcement. Take care and if you need anything else =
give me a shout. The stokc is CNRMF and if I were you id grab as many =
shares as I can, everyone at the office thinks this one is gonna go up =
at least 5x soon.
