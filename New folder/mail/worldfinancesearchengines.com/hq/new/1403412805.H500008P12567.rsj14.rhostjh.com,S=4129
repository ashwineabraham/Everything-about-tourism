Dear hq,

I was very furious when I listened to your voicemail last night.

You know, I didtell you about last month but you=92re the one who was =
not interested inbuying at the time. It was trading for just 10 or 15 =
cents if I remembercorrectly. You cannot now blame me by saying I =
didn=92t tell you.

Anyway bullshit aside if you are still angry about missing the first =
wave I=92mtelling you its not too late but you need to listen to me now =
and buy as manys.h.a.r.es of as you can on Monday morning before they =
get too expensive and ifyou don=92t it=92s your own fault I don=92t want =
you calling me again and leaving meanother nasty voicemail.

I spoke with my analyst buddy who is working on this specific =
stock-analysis andhe told me we should expect to see shares hit past a =
dollar within the next 30days. Do what you must.

Take care
Your bud
Milagros
