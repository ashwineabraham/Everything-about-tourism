VERY CONFIDENTIAL

I decided to forward to you this proposal. I want a reliable person who could assist me to transfer the sum of US$10.5M (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) only into his account.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from a contract awarded by Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) under my approval, allocated to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed. Commissioned, the contractor has been paid his actual cost for the contract. A balance of US$10.5M as the over-invoiced amount is left, which I have deliberately over estimated for our own use. But under my protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to operate or own a foreign account. This is why I contacted you for assistance. You will be entitled to 30% of the total sum, 60% for me while 10% for any expenses incurred while transacting the business and whatever left from the 10% will be shared equally. As you may rightly want to know I got your email address from our Chambers of Commerce and Industry. I am a top official with the Department Of Petroleum Resources (DPR). I have put in many years of services to o
 ur ministries. I have been exerci

To enable the payment of this fund into your account, I have to present an international business outfit and consequent upon your agreement, I will Incorporate your company Name with your name or company name over here and I will process all the necessary paper work to facilitate this transaction. As soon as the funds are remitted into your nominated account, I will visit you to arrange for my share. 

With your total co-operation all these will only take about 10 working days to transfer this fund into your account right from the day I receive the requirements. NOTE: Your discussion regarding to this transaction should be limited, because I am still in Government service. Let honesty and trust be our watchwords throughout this transaction. And your Prompt reply will be highly appreciated.

Best regards.

Mr. Thomas Akhimen
