Hello,</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
My name is Lokman Bin Yahya&nbsp; from Malaysia. I am a retired politician/ businessman. i got your email address through a personnel directory in my search for a reliable individual,that will partner me.It will be my pleasure to have your attention,regarding a proposal for mutual investment partnership,involving USD 28,000,000,00. The proposed sum for investment,was carefully packed and sealed in 2 cash trunks,which was deposited with a security company in London-UK,and the cash will be delivered to you in, your country.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I am very sick at the moment,and doctors said I have 3 more months to live,though I am still receiving treatment in a London hospital and no longer enjoy good relationship with my native Government,because of my then political ambition,and criticism of their policies ,hence the need to move this fund abroad,to avoid loosing it to the Government,if I&nbsp; die,since I&nbsp; have no child nor a wife.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I need an individual or company,who can utilize the funds for profitable business investment,where my own share of the profits can be channeled to research/development grants that will benefit mankind and charity works,since I can no longer do much because of my frail health,and have no child or wife to inherit my wealth. I will offer you 30% of the principal sum,plus another 20% of the profits realized from the investment annually,if you can stand as my appointed</DIV>
<DIV>
beneficiary and receive the sum,secure the funds in your account for investment partnership.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Kindly provide your full names, address,occupation, and direct telephone number. Upon your response,I will send to you my&nbsp; international passport,a copy of the deposit Certificate,when the deposit was made with a security company in London-UK,the fund origin certificate which confirms the funds clean and cleared.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Take care and God bless.</DIV>
<DIV>
Mr. Lokman Bin Yahya.</DIV>
