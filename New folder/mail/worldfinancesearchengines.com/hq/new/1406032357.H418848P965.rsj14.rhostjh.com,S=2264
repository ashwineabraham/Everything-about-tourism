My name is MISS CATHERINE LADAN.  I am 27 years old, just started working with Citi Bank here in London. I came across your file marked X and your released disk painted RED. I took time to study it and tried to find out why the funds were not released to you.

I do not intend to work here forever; I can help you claim your fund if you can certify me of my security and assure me that you would settle with me after you must have received your payment.

I must do this because you need to know the status of your payment and cause for the delay. You fund was moved from the Central Bank of Nigeria to Citi Bank here in London. The only documents needed to release your fund to you is the non residual Certificate which will be tendered to any of your nominated bank and the Internal Revenue Service IRS for clearance of the transferred amount in your account.

Once the non residual Certificate is secured, your fund will released and transferred to your account without.

Do get back to me ASAP to give you details on how to go about your claim if you are still serious about receiving your fund.


Yours sincerely,
MISS CATHERINE LADAN
